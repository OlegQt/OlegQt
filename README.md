# Hello
##### My name is Oleg 
*I am a beginner Android developer. My background is in microelectronics, but I decided to try myself in programming. I have always been interested in this field because it allows me to be creative without limits. In 2023, I completed an Android development course at Yandex Praktikum, and now I plan to further develop my skills in this profession. With the advent of the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence, the interaction between people and devices will only continue to grow. Mobile applications will play an important role in simplifying human life.*
